# Habit-Tracker-and-Task-Planner
<br/>

## Main characteristics
Android application written in Java that offers support for both tracking customizable habits (Yes/No or Numerical, various repeat patterns, difficulty, etc.) and managing tasks. The app offers an overview of the user's success by quantifying realizations based on a personal formula, statistics and descriptive graphs. The habit strength is calculated as a weighted average between the habit's current, best, average and past streaks relative to the habit's difficulty which is represented as the number of days necessary for the habit to form, according to a study from 2009. The score is calculated as a weighted average between an exponential smoothing forecast of the next day's realization, the habit strength and, in the case of numerical habits, a total deviation from the actual numerical goal. Any habit or task can be included in a category for the sake of statistics. There's also a series of achievements the user can unlock for a habit. Notifications are sent before each task's deadline which can be snoozed. The database and authentication functionality were developed using the Firebase platform. Users can create an account based on a valid e-mail and password.
